Agartha Mission Paper Draft

Agartha’s mission is to create a decentralized network of regenerative, resilient and sovereign communities.

- **Regenerative**
    
    Our current societies are used to extrapolate resources to achieve short-term gain instead of creating solutions for long term growth. We believe that sustainability is the next frontier of innovation. 
    
    We want to encourage solutions that utilizes waste and by-products of human activities in ways that are not detrimental or consuming of the future of our ecology.
    
    We hope to help building communities living among regenerative ecosystems with renewable energy, up-cycling waste systems and the abundance of natural resources.
    
- **Resilient**
    
    We have become an extremely inter-dependent global network, that economical and infrastructural collapse in one area can have detrimental effects at the opposite side of the globe. During the Covid crisis we witnessed how fragile and dependent the global supply chain really is. In creating new living spaces for the next generation of communities, we want to encourage self-reliant and resilient local productions and infrastructure.
    
    In other words, we want to encourage communities to source local productions for necessities such as food, water, energy, and raw materials for shelter.
    
- **Sovereign**
    
    Because sovereignty and freedom are the foundation of individual expressions and personal growth, we want to help curate spaces that allow individuals to be as free, expressive and authentic as they can be, while living among group dynamics that are equally harmonious for all.
    
    Liberty and equality often interfere with each other. We aim to investigate how to best strike a balance amongst such values for the context and people in any given living community.
    
    Agartha plays no part in suggesting on any spiritual or religious believes for any communities we support and curate, while at the same time we want to emphasize the importance of sovereignty for each community and individual to practice whichever religion or belief systems as they see fit, with the bottom line of avoiding harming others.
    
    We believe that the future is decentralized, and we want to help create the vision of a globally connected network of smart village communities that are locally operated and globally connected.
    

Our goals:

- Create a research library on the subject of:
    - Community Governance Typology
    - Conflict Resolution
    - Communication Templates
    - Sustainable Farming
    - Waste Recycling
    - Composting Solutions ([https://permies.com/](https://permies.com/))
    - Vernacular Architecture
    - Renewable Energy ([https://www.appropedia.org/Welcome_to_Appropedia](https://www.appropedia.org/Welcome_to_Appropedia))
    - Regenerative Finance

- Create a network of community builders and enthusiasts to collectively share resources, and build prototypes and communities together.

- Operate as a DAO with on-chain governance and representative democracy, to let our contributors and community decide on approaches we should take, and areas we should be focusing on. This way Agartha will be an on-going project with its mission constantly evolving and carved out by its community of contributors. Together we’ll form a living organism that defines what Agartha can be.
